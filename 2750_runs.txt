The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters

Beautiful is better than ugly.
Explicit is better than implicit.
Simple is better than complex.
Complex is better than complicated.
Flat is better than nested.
Sparse is better than dense.
Readability counts.
Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
Although practicality beats purity.
Errors should never pass silently.
Unless explicitly silenced.
In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
Now is better than never.
Although never is often better than *right* now.
If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!

Help on package numpy.linalg in numpy:

NAME
    numpy.linalg

DESCRIPTION
    ``numpy.linalg``
    ================
    
    The NumPy linear algebra functions rely on BLAS and LAPACK to provide efficient
    low level implementations of standard linear algebra algorithms. Those
    libraries may be provided by NumPy itself using C versions of a subset of their
    reference implementations but, when possible, highly optimized libraries that
    take advantage of specialized processor functionality are preferred. Examples
    of such libraries are OpenBLAS, MKL (TM), and ATLAS. Because those libraries
    are multithreaded and processor dependent, environmental variables and external
    packages such as threadpoolctl may be needed to control the number of threads
    or specify the processor architecture.
    
    - OpenBLAS: https://www.openblas.net/
    - threadpoolctl: https://github.com/joblib/threadpoolctl
    
    Please note that the most-used linear algebra functions in NumPy are present in
    the main ``numpy`` namespace rather than in ``numpy.linalg``.  There are:
    ``dot``, ``vdot``, ``inner``, ``outer``, ``matmul``, ``tensordot``, ``einsum``,
    ``einsum_path`` and ``kron``.

FUNCTIONS
    cholesky(a)
        Cholesky decomposition.
        
        Return the Cholesky decomposition, `L * L.H`, of the square matrix `a`,
        where `L` is lower-triangular and .H is the conjugate transpose operator
        (which is the ordinary transpose if `a` is real-valued).  `a` must be
        Hermitian (symmetric if real-valued) and positive-definite. No
        checking is performed to verify whether `a` is Hermitian or not.
        In addition, only the lower-triangular and diagonal elements of `a`
        are used. Only `L` is actually returned.
        
        Parameters
        ----------
        a : (..., M, M) array_like
            Hermitian (symmetric if all elements are real), positive-definite
            input matrix.
        
        Returns
        -------
        L : (..., M, M) array_like
            Upper or lower-triangular Cholesky factor of `a`.  Returns a
            matrix object if `a` is a matrix object.
        
        Raises
        ------
        LinAlgError
           If the decomposition fails, for example, if `a` is not
           positive-definite.
        
        See Also
        --------
        scipy.linalg.cholesky : Similar function in SciPy.
        scipy.linalg.cholesky_banded : Cholesky decompose a banded Hermitian
                                       positive-definite matrix.
        scipy.linalg.cho_factor : Cholesky decomposition of a matrix, to use in
                                  `scipy.linalg.cho_solve`.

        details.
        
        The Cholesky decomposition is often used as a fast way of solving
        
        .. math:: A \mathbf{x} = \mathbf{b}
        
        (when `A` is both Hermitian/symmetric and positive-definite).
        
        First, we solve for :math:`\mathbf{y}` in
        
        .. math:: L \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{b},
        
        and then for :math:`\mathbf{x}` in
        
        .. math:: L.H \mathbf{x} = \mathbf{y}.
        
        Examples
        --------
        >>> A = np.array([[1,-2j],[2j,5]])
        >>> A
        array([[ 1.+0.j, -0.-2.j],
               [ 0.+2.j,  5.+0.j]])
        >>> L = np.linalg.cholesky(A)
        >>> L
        array([[1.+0.j, 0.+0.j],
               [0.+2.j, 1.+0.j]])
        >>> np.dot(L, L.T.conj()) # verify that L * L.H = A
        array([[1.+0.j, 0.-2.j],
               [0.+2.j, 5.+0.j]])
        >>> A = [[1,-2j],[2j,5]] # what happens if A is only array_like?
        >>> np.linalg.cholesky(A) # an ndarray object is returned
        array([[1.+0.j, 0.+0.j],
               [0.+2.j, 1.+0.j]])
        >>> # But a matrix object is returned if A is a matrix object
        >>> np.linalg.cholesky(np.matrix(A))
        matrix([[ 1.+0.j,  0.+0.j],
                [ 0.+2.j,  1.+0.j]])
    
    cond(x, p=None)
        Compute the condition number of a matrix.
        
        This function is capable of returning the condition number using
        one of seven different norms, depending on the value of `p` (see
        Parameters below).
        
        Parameters
        ----------
        x : (..., M, N) array_like
            The matrix whose condition number is sought.
        p : {None, 1, -1, 2, -2, inf, -inf, 'fro'}, optional
            Order of the norm used in the condition number computation:
        
            =====  ============================
            p      norm for matrices
            =====  ============================
            None   2-norm, computed directly using the ``SVD``
            'fro'  Frobenius norm
            inf    max(sum(abs(x), axis=1))
            -inf   min(sum(abs(x), axis=1))
            1      max(sum(abs(x), axis=0))
            -1     min(sum(abs(x), axis=0))
            2      2-norm (largest sing. value)
            -2     smallest singular value
            =====  ============================
        
            inf means the `numpy.inf` object, and the Frobenius norm is
            the root-of-sum-of-squares norm.
        
        Returns
        -------
        c : {float, inf}
            The condition number of the matrix. May be infinite.
        
        See Also
        --------
        numpy.linalg.norm
        
        Notes
        -----
        The condition number of `x` is defined as the norm of `x` times the
        norm of the inverse of `x` [1]_; the norm can be the usual L2-norm
        (root-of-sum-of-squares) or one of a number of other matrix norms.

    eig(a)
        Compute the eigenvalues and right eigenvectors of a square array.
        
        Parameters
        ----------
        a : (..., M, M) array
            Matrices for which the eigenvalues and right eigenvectors will
            be computed

        w : (..., M) array
            The eigenvalues, each repeated according to its multiplicity.
            The eigenvalues are not necessarily ordered. The resulting
            array will be of complex type, unless the imaginary part is
            zero in which case it will be cast to a real type. When `a`
            is real the resulting eigenvalues will be real (0 imaginary
            part) or occur in conjugate pairs
        
        v : (..., M, M) array
            The normalized (unit "length") eigenvectors, such that the
            column ``v[:,i]`` is the eigenvector corresponding to the
            eigenvalue ``w[i]``.
        
        Raises
        ------
        LinAlgError

        Notes
        -----
        
        .. versionadded:: 1.8.0
        
        Broadcasting rules apply, see the `numpy.linalg` documentation for
        details.
        
        This is implemented using the ``_geev`` LAPACK routines which compute
        the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of general square arrays.
        
        The number `w` is an eigenvalue of `a` if there exists a vector
        `v` such that ``a @ v = w * v``. Thus, the arrays `a`, `w`, and
        `v` satisfy the equations ``a @ v[:,i] = w[i] * v[:,i]``
        for :math:`i \in \{0,...,M-1\}`.
        
        The array `v` of eigenvectors may not be of maximum rank, that is, some
        of the columns may be linearly dependent, although round-off error may
        obscure that fact. If the eigenvalues are all different, then theoretically
        the eigenvectors are linearly independent and `a` can be diagonalized by
        a similarity transformation using `v`, i.e, ``inv(v) @ a @ v`` is diagonal.
        
        For non-Hermitian normal matrices the SciPy function `scipy.linalg.schur`
        is preferred because the matrix `v` is guaranteed to be unitary, which is
        not the case when using `eig`. The Schur factorization produces an
        upper triangular matrix rather than a diagonal matrix, but for normal
        matrices only the diagonal of the upper triangular matrix is needed, the
        rest is roundoff error.
        
        Finally, it is emphasized that `v` consists of the *right* (as in
        right-hand side) eigenvectors of `a`.  A vector `y` satisfying
        ``y.T @ a = z * y.T`` for some number `z` is called a *left*
        eigenvector of `a`, and, in general, the left and right eigenvectors
        of a matrix are not necessarily the (perhaps conjugate) transposes
        of each other.

    eigh(a, UPLO='L')
        Return the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a complex Hermitian
        (conjugate symmetric) or a real symmetric matrix.
        
        Returns two objects, a 1-D array containing the eigenvalues of `a`, and
        a 2-D square array or matrix (depending on the input type) of the
        corresponding eigenvectors (in columns).
        
        Parameters
        ----------
        a : (..., M, M) array
            Hermitian or real symmetric matrices whose eigenvalues and
            eigenvectors are to be computed.
        UPLO : {'L', 'U'}, optional
            Specifies whether the calculation is done with the lower triangular
            part of `a` ('L', default) or the upper triangular part ('U').
            Irrespective of this value only the real parts of the diagonal will
            be considered in the computation to preserve the notion of a Hermitian
            matrix. It therefore follows that the imaginary part of the diagonal
            will always be treated as zero.
        
        Returns
        -------
        w : (..., M) ndarray
            The eigenvalues in ascending order, each repeated according to
            its multiplicity.
        v : {(..., M, M) ndarray, (..., M, M) matrix}
            The column ``v[:, i]`` is the normalized eigenvector corresponding
            to the eigenvalue ``w[i]``.  Will return a matrix object if `a` is
            a matrix object.
        
        Raises
        ------
        LinAlgError
            If the eigenvalue computation does not converge.

        a : (..., M, M) array_like
            A complex- or real-valued matrix whose eigenvalues will be computed.

        the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of general square arrays.
        
        Examples
        --------
        Illustration, using the fact that the eigenvalues of a diagonal matrix
        are its diagonal elements, that multiplying a matrix on the left
        by an orthogonal matrix, `Q`, and on the right by `Q.T` (the transpose
        of `Q`), preserves the eigenvalues of the "middle" matrix.  In other words,
        if `Q` is orthogonal, then ``Q * A * Q.T`` has the same eigenvalues as
        ``A``:
        
        >>> from numpy import linalg as LA
        >>> x = np.random.random()
        >>> Q = np.array([[np.cos(x), -np.sin(x)], [np.sin(x), np.cos(x)]])

        (1.0, 1.0, 0.0)
        
        Now multiply a diagonal matrix by ``Q`` on one side and by ``Q.T`` on the other:
        
        >>> D = np.diag((-1,1))
        >>> LA.eigvals(D)

        >>> LA.eigvals(A)
        array([ 1., -1.]) # random
    
    eigvalsh(a, UPLO='L')
        Compute the eigenvalues of a complex Hermitian or real symmetric matrix.
        
        Main difference from eigh: the eigenvectors are not computed.
        
        Parameters
        ----------

        Parameters

        Returns
        -------
        ainv : (..., M, M) ndarray or matrix
            (Multiplicative) inverse of the matrix `a`.
        
        Raises
        ------

        Examples

        >>> from numpy.linalg import inv

        >>> np.allclose(np.dot(ainv, a), np.eye(2))
        True
        
        If a is a matrix object, then the return value is a matrix as well:

        matrix([[-2. ,  1. ],
                [ 1.5, -0.5]])
        
        Inverses of several matrices can be computed at once:

    lstsq(a, b, rcond='warn')
        Return the least-squares solution to a linear matrix equation.
        
        Computes the vector `x` that approximately solves the equation
        ``a @ x = b``. The equation may be under-, well-, or over-determined
        (i.e., the number of linearly independent rows of `a` can be less than,
        equal to, or greater than its number of linearly independent columns).
        If `a` is square and of full rank, then `x` (but for round-off error)
        is the "exact" solution of the equation. Else, `x` minimizes the
        Euclidean 2-norm :math:`||b - ax||`. If there are multiple minimizing
        solutions, the one with the smallest 2-norm :math:`||x||` is returned.
        
        Parameters
        ----------
        a : (M, N) array_like
            "Coefficient" matrix.
        b : {(M,), (M, K)} array_like
            Ordinate or "dependent variable" values. If `b` is two-dimensional,
            the least-squares solution is calculated for each of the `K` columns
            of `b`.
        rcond : float, optional
            Cut-off ratio for small singular values of `a`.
            For the purposes of rank determination, singular values are treated
            as zero if they are smaller than `rcond` times the largest singular
            value of `a`.
        
            .. versionchanged:: 1.14.0
               If not set, a FutureWarning is given. The previous default
               of ``-1`` will use the machine precision as `rcond` parameter,
               the new default will use the machine precision times `max(M, N)`.
               To silence the warning and use the new default, use ``rcond=None``,
               to keep using the old behavior, use ``rcond=-1``.
        
        Returns

        x : {(N,), (N, K)} ndarray
            Least-squares solution. If `b` is two-dimensional,
            the solutions are in the `K` columns of `x`.
        residuals : {(1,), (K,), (0,)} ndarray
            Sums of squared residuals: Squared Euclidean 2-norm for each column in
            ``b - a @ x``.
            If the rank of `a` is < N or M <= N, this is an empty array.
            If `b` is 1-dimensional, this is a (1,) shape array.
            Otherwise the shape is (K,).
        rank : int
            Rank of matrix `a`.
        s : (min(M, N),) ndarray
            Singular values of `a`.
        
        Raises
        ------
        LinAlgError
            If computation does not converge.

        Notes
        -----
        If `b` is a matrix, then all array results are returned as matrices.
        
        Examples
        --------
        Fit a line, ``y = mx + c``, through some noisy data-points:
        
        >>> x = np.array([0, 1, 2, 3])
        >>> y = np.array([-1, 0.2, 0.9, 2.1])
        
        By examining the coefficients, we see that the line should have a
        gradient of roughly 1 and cut the y-axis at, more or less, -1.
        
        We can rewrite the line equation as ``y = Ap``, where ``A = [[x 1]]``
        and ``p = [[m], [c]]``.  Now use `lstsq` to solve for `p`:
        
        >>> A = np.vstack([x, np.ones(len(x))]).T
        >>> A
        array([[ 0.,  1.],
               [ 1.,  1.],
               [ 2.,  1.],
               [ 3.,  1.]])
        
        >>> m, c = np.linalg.lstsq(A, y, rcond=None)[0]
        >>> m, c
        (1.0 -0.95) # may vary
        
        Plot the data along with the fitted line:
        
        >>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
        >>> _ = plt.plot(x, y, 'o', label='Original data', markersize=10)
        >>> _ = plt.plot(x, m*x + c, 'r', label='Fitted line')
        >>> _ = plt.legend()
        >>> plt.show()
    
    matrix_power(a, n)
        Raise a square matrix to the (integer) power `n`.
        
        For positive integers `n`, the power is computed by repeated matrix
        squarings and matrix multiplications. If ``n == 0``, the identity matrix
        of the same shape as M is returned. If ``n < 0``, the inverse
        is computed and then raised to the ``abs(n)``.
        
        .. note:: Stacks of object matrices are not currently supported.
        
        Parameters
        ----------
        a : (..., M, M) array_like
            Matrix to be "powered".
        n : int
            The exponent can be any integer or long integer, positive,
            negative, or zero.
        
        Returns
        -------
        a**n : (..., M, M) ndarray or matrix object
            The return value is the same shape and type as `M`;
            if the exponent is positive or zero then the type of the
            elements is the same as those of `M`. If the exponent is
            negative the elements are floating-point.
        
        Raises
        ------
        LinAlgError
            For matrices that are not square or that (for negative powers) cannot
            be inverted numerically.
        
        Examples
        --------
        >>> from numpy.linalg import matrix_power
        >>> i = np.array([[0, 1], [-1, 0]]) # matrix equiv. of the imaginary unit
        >>> matrix_power(i, 3) # should = -i
        array([[ 0, -1],
               [ 1,  0]])
        >>> matrix_power(i, 0)
        array([[1, 0],
               [0, 1]])
        >>> matrix_power(i, -3) # should = 1/(-i) = i, but w/ f.p. elements
        array([[ 0.,  1.],
               [-1.,  0.]])
        
        Somewhat more sophisticated example
        
        >>> q = np.zeros((4, 4))
        >>> q[0:2, 0:2] = -i
        >>> q[2:4, 2:4] = i
        >>> q # one of the three quaternion units not equal to 1
        array([[ 0., -1.,  0.,  0.],
               [ 1.,  0.,  0.,  0.],
               [ 0.,  0.,  0.,  1.],
               [ 0.,  0., -1.,  0.]])
        >>> matrix_power(q, 2) # = -np.eye(4)
        array([[-1.,  0.,  0.,  0.],
               [ 0., -1.,  0.,  0.],
               [ 0.,  0., -1.,  0.],
               [ 0.,  0.,  0., -1.]])
    
    matrix_rank(A, tol=None, hermitian=False)
        Return matrix rank of array using SVD method
        
        Rank of the array is the number of singular values of the array that are
        greater than `tol`.
        
        .. versionchanged:: 1.14
           Can now operate on stacks of matrices
        
        Parameters
        ----------
        A : {(M,), (..., M, N)} array_like
            Input vector or stack of matrices.
        tol : (...) array_like, float, optional
            Threshold below which SVD values are considered zero. If `tol` is
            None, and ``S`` is an array with singular values for `M`, and
            ``eps`` is the epsilon value for datatype of ``S``, then `tol` is
            set to ``S.max() * max(M, N) * eps``.
        
            .. versionchanged:: 1.14
               Broadcasted against the stack of matrices
        hermitian : bool, optional
            If True, `A` is assumed to be Hermitian (symmetric if real-valued),
            enabling a more efficient method for finding singular values.
            Defaults to False.
        
            .. versionadded:: 1.14
        
        Returns
        -------
        rank : (...) array_like
            Rank of A.
        
        Notes
        -----
        The default threshold to detect rank deficiency is a test on the magnitude
        of the singular values of `A`.  By default, we identify singular values less
        than ``S.max() * max(M, N) * eps`` as indicating rank deficiency (with
        the symbols defined above). This is the algorithm MATLAB uses [1].  It also
        appears in *Numerical recipes* in the discussion of SVD solutions for linear
        least squares [2].
        
        This default threshold is designed to detect rank deficiency accounting for
        the numerical errors of the SVD computation.  Imagine that there is a column
        in `A` that is an exact (in floating point) linear combination of other
        columns in `A`. Computing the SVD on `A` will not produce a singular value
        exactly equal to 0 in general: any difference of the smallest SVD value from
        0 will be caused by numerical imprecision in the calculation of the SVD.
        Our threshold for small SVD values takes this numerical imprecision into
        account, and the default threshold will detect such numerical rank
        deficiency.  The threshold may declare a matrix `A` rank deficient even if
        the linear combination of some columns of `A` is not exactly equal to
        another column of `A` but only numerically very close to another column of
        `A`.
        
        We chose our default threshold because it is in wide use.  Other thresholds
        are possible.  For example, elsewhere in the 2007 edition of *Numerical
        recipes* there is an alternative threshold of ``S.max() *
        np.finfo(A.dtype).eps / 2. * np.sqrt(m + n + 1.)``. The authors describe
        this threshold as being based on "expected roundoff error" (p 71).
        
        The thresholds above deal with floating point roundoff error in the
        calculation of the SVD.  However, you may have more information about the
        sources of error in `A` that would make you consider other tolerance values
        to detect *effective* rank deficiency.  The most useful measure of the
        tolerance depends on the operations you intend to use on your matrix.  For
        example, if your data come from uncertain measurements with uncertainties
        greater than floating point epsilon, choosing a tolerance near that
        uncertainty may be preferable.  The tolerance may be absolute if the
        uncertainties are absolute rather than relative.

    multi_dot(arrays, *, out=None)
        Compute the dot product of two or more arrays in a single function call,
        while automatically selecting the fastest evaluation order.
        
        `multi_dot` chains `numpy.dot` and uses optimal parenthesization
        of the matrices [1]_ [2]_. Depending on the shapes of the matrices,
        this can speed up the multiplication a lot.
        
        If the first argument is 1-D it is treated as a row vector.
        If the last argument is 1-D it is treated as a column vector.
        The other arguments must be 2-D.
        
        Think of `multi_dot` as::
        
            def multi_dot(arrays): return functools.reduce(np.dot, arrays)
        
        
        Parameters
        ----------
        arrays : sequence of array_like
            If the first argument is 1-D it is treated as row vector.
            If the last argument is 1-D it is treated as column vector.
            The other arguments must be 2-D.
        out : ndarray, optional
            Output argument. This must have the exact kind that would be returned
            if it was not used. In particular, it must have the right type, must be
            C-contiguous, and its dtype must be the dtype that would be returned
            for `dot(a, b)`. This is a performance feature. Therefore, if these
            conditions are not met, an exception is raised, instead of attempting
            to be flexible.

        Returns
        -------
        output : ndarray
            Returns the dot product of the supplied arrays.

        Examples

        >>> A = np.random.random((10000, 100))
        >>> B = np.random.random((100, 1000))
        >>> C = np.random.random((1000, 5))
        >>> D = np.random.random((5, 333))
        >>> # the actual dot multiplication
        >>> _ = multi_dot([A, B, C, D])
        
        instead of::
        
        >>> _ = np.dot(np.dot(np.dot(A, B), C), D)
        >>> # or
        >>> _ = A.dot(B).dot(C).dot(D)
        
        Notes
        -----
        The cost for a matrix multiplication can be calculated with the
        following function::
        
            def cost(A, B):
                return A.shape[0] * A.shape[1] * B.shape[1]
        
        Assume we have three matrices
        :math:`A_{10x100}, B_{100x5}, C_{5x50}`.
        
        The costs for the two different parenthesizations are as follows::
        
            cost((AB)C) = 10*100*5 + 10*5*50   = 5000 + 2500   = 7500
            cost(A(BC)) = 10*100*50 + 100*5*50 = 50000 + 25000 = 75000
    
    norm(x, ord=None, axis=None, keepdims=False)
        Matrix or vector norm.
        
        This function is able to return one of eight different matrix norms,
        or one of an infinite number of vector norms (described below), depending
        on the value of the ``ord`` parameter.
        
        Parameters
        ----------
        x : array_like
            Input array.  If `axis` is None, `x` must be 1-D or 2-D, unless `ord`
            is None. If both `axis` and `ord` are None, the 2-norm of
            ``x.ravel`` will be returned.
        ord : {non-zero int, inf, -inf, 'fro', 'nuc'}, optional
            Order of the norm (see table under ``Notes``). inf means numpy's
            `inf` object. The default is None.
        axis : {None, int, 2-tuple of ints}, optional.
            If `axis` is an integer, it specifies the axis of `x` along which to
            compute the vector norms.  If `axis` is a 2-tuple, it specifies the
            axes that hold 2-D matrices, and the matrix norms of these matrices
            are computed.  If `axis` is None then either a vector norm (when `x`
            is 1-D) or a matrix norm (when `x` is 2-D) is returned. The default
            is None.
        
            .. versionadded:: 1.8.0
        
        keepdims : bool, optional
            If this is set to True, the axes which are normed over are left in the
            result as dimensions with size one.  With this option the result will
            broadcast correctly against the original `x`.
        
            .. versionadded:: 1.10.0
        
        Returns
        -------
        n : float or ndarray
            Norm of the matrix or vector(s).

        Notes
        -----
        For values of ``ord < 1``, the result is, strictly speaking, not a
        mathematical 'norm', but it may still be useful for various numerical
        purposes.
        
        The following norms can be calculated:

        -inf   min(sum(abs(x), axis=1))      min(abs(x))
        0      --                            sum(x != 0)

        -1     min(sum(abs(x), axis=0))      as below
        2      2-norm (largest sing. value)  as below
        -2     smallest singular value       as below
        other  --                            sum(abs(x)**ord)**(1./ord)
        =====  ============================  ==========================
        
        The Frobenius norm is given by [1]_:
        
            :math:`||A||_F = [\sum_{i,j} abs(a_{i,j})^2]^{1/2}`
        
        The nuclear norm is the sum of the singular values.
        
        Both the Frobenius and nuclear norm orders are only defined for
        matrices and raise a ValueError when ``x.ndim != 2``.

        Calculate the generalized inverse of a matrix using its
        singular-value decomposition (SVD) and including all
        *large* singular values.
        
        .. versionchanged:: 1.14
           Can now operate on stacks of matrices
        
        Parameters
        ----------
        a : (..., M, N) array_like
            Matrix or stack of matrices to be pseudo-inverted.
        rcond : (...) array_like of float
            Cutoff for small singular values.
            Singular values less than or equal to
            ``rcond * largest_singular_value`` are set to zero.
            Broadcasts against the stack of matrices.
        hermitian : bool, optional
            If True, `a` is assumed to be Hermitian (symmetric if real-valued),

            Defaults to False.

        Returns
        -------
        B : (..., N, M) ndarray
            The pseudo-inverse of `a`. If `a` is a `matrix` instance, then so
            is `B`.

        ------
        LinAlgError

        Notes
        -----
        The pseudo-inverse of a matrix A, denoted :math:`A^+`, is
        defined as: "the matrix that 'solves' [the least-squares problem]
        :math:`Ax = b`," i.e., if :math:`\bar{x}` is said solution, then
        :math:`A^+` is that matrix such that :math:`\bar{x} = A^+b`.
        
        It can be shown that if :math:`Q_1 \Sigma Q_2^T = A` is the singular
        value decomposition of A, then
        :math:`A^+ = Q_2 \Sigma^+ Q_1^T`, where :math:`Q_{1,2}` are
        orthogonal matrices, :math:`\Sigma` is a diagonal matrix consisting
        of A's so-called singular values, (followed, typically, by
        zeros), and then :math:`\Sigma^+` is simply the diagonal matrix
        consisting of the reciprocals of A's singular values
        (again, followed by zeros). [1]_

        Examples
        --------
        The following example checks that ``a * a+ * a == a`` and
        ``a+ * a * a+ == a+``:
        
        >>> a = np.random.randn(9, 6)
        >>> B = np.linalg.pinv(a)
        >>> np.allclose(a, np.dot(a, np.dot(B, a)))
        True
        >>> np.allclose(B, np.dot(B, np.dot(a, B)))
        True
    
    qr(a, mode='reduced')
        Compute the qr factorization of a matrix.
        
        Factor the matrix `a` as *qr*, where `q` is orthonormal and `r` is
        upper-triangular.
        
        Parameters
        ----------
        a : array_like, shape (..., M, N)
            An array-like object with the dimensionality of at least 2.
        mode : {'reduced', 'complete', 'r', 'raw'}, optional
            If K = min(M, N), then
        
            * 'reduced'  : returns q, r with dimensions
                           (..., M, K), (..., K, N) (default)
            * 'complete' : returns q, r with dimensions (..., M, M), (..., M, N)
            * 'r'        : returns r only with dimensions (..., K, N)
            * 'raw'      : returns h, tau with dimensions (..., N, M), (..., K,)
        
            The options 'reduced', 'complete, and 'raw' are new in numpy 1.8,
            see the notes for more information. The default is 'reduced', and to
            maintain backward compatibility with earlier versions of numpy both
            it and the old default 'full' can be omitted. Note that array h
            returned in 'raw' mode is transposed for calling Fortran. The
            'economic' mode is deprecated.  The modes 'full' and 'economic' may
            be passed using only the first letter for backwards compatibility,
            but all others must be spelled out. See the Notes for more
            explanation.
        
        
        Returns
        -------
        q : ndarray of float or complex, optional
            A matrix with orthonormal columns. When mode = 'complete' the
            result is an orthogonal/unitary matrix depending on whether or not
            a is real/complex. The determinant may be either +/- 1 in that
            case. In case the number of dimensions in the input array is
            greater than 2 then a stack of the matrices with above properties
            is returned.
        r : ndarray of float or complex, optional
            The upper-triangular matrix or a stack of upper-triangular
            matrices if the number of dimensions in the input array is greater
            than 2.
        (h, tau) : ndarrays of np.double or np.cdouble, optional
            The array h contains the Householder reflectors that generate q
            along with r. The tau array contains scaling factors for the
            reflectors. In the deprecated  'economic' mode only h is returned.
        
        Raises
        ------
        LinAlgError
            If factoring fails.

        scipy.linalg.rq : Compute RQ decomposition of a matrix.
        
        Notes
        -----
        This is an interface to the LAPACK routines ``dgeqrf``, ``zgeqrf``,
        ``dorgqr``, and ``zungqr``.
        
        For more information on the qr factorization, see for example:
        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QR_factorization
        
        Subclasses of `ndarray` are preserved except for the 'raw' mode. So if
        `a` is of type `matrix`, all the return values will be matrices too.
        
        New 'reduced', 'complete', and 'raw' options for mode were added in
        NumPy 1.8.0 and the old option 'full' was made an alias of 'reduced'.  In
        addition the options 'full' and 'economic' were deprecated.  Because
        'full' was the previous default and 'reduced' is the new default,
        backward compatibility can be maintained by letting `mode` default.
        The 'raw' option was added so that LAPACK routines that can multiply
        arrays by q using the Householder reflectors can be used. Note that in
        this case the returned arrays are of type np.double or np.cdouble and
        the h array is transposed to be FORTRAN compatible.  No routines using
        the 'raw' return are currently exposed by numpy, but some are available
        in lapack_lite and just await the necessary work.
        
        Examples
        --------
        >>> a = np.random.randn(9, 6)
        >>> q, r = np.linalg.qr(a)
        >>> np.allclose(a, np.dot(q, r))  # a does equal qr
        True
        >>> r2 = np.linalg.qr(a, mode='r')
        >>> np.allclose(r, r2)  # mode='r' returns the same r as mode='full'
        True
        >>> a = np.random.normal(size=(3, 2, 2)) # Stack of 2 x 2 matrices as input
        >>> q, r = np.linalg.qr(a)
        >>> q.shape
        (3, 2, 2)
        >>> r.shape
        (3, 2, 2)
        >>> np.allclose(a, np.matmul(q, r))
        True
        
        Example illustrating a common use of `qr`: solving of least squares
        problems
        
        What are the least-squares-best `m` and `y0` in ``y = y0 + mx`` for
        the following data: {(0,1), (1,0), (1,2), (2,1)}. (Graph the points
        and you'll see that it should be y0 = 0, m = 1.)  The answer is provided
        by solving the over-determined matrix equation ``Ax = b``, where::
        
          A = array([[0, 1], [1, 1], [1, 1], [2, 1]])
          x = array([[y0], [m]])
          b = array([[1], [0], [2], [1]])
        
        If A = qr such that q is orthonormal (which is always possible via
        Gram-Schmidt), then ``x = inv(r) * (q.T) * b``.  (In numpy practice,
        however, we simply use `lstsq`.)
        
        >>> A = np.array([[0, 1], [1, 1], [1, 1], [2, 1]])
        >>> A
        array([[0, 1],
               [1, 1],
               [1, 1],
               [2, 1]])
        >>> b = np.array([1, 0, 2, 1])
        >>> q, r = np.linalg.qr(A)
        >>> p = np.dot(q.T, b)
        >>> np.dot(np.linalg.inv(r), p)
        array([  1.1e-16,   1.0e+00])
    
    slogdet(a)
        Compute the sign and (natural) logarithm of the determinant of an array.
        
        If an array has a very small or very large determinant, then a call to
        `det` may overflow or underflow. This routine is more robust against such
        issues, because it computes the logarithm of the determinant rather than
        the determinant itself.
        
        Parameters
        ----------
        a : (..., M, M) array_like
            Input array, has to be a square 2-D array.
        
        Returns
        -------
        sign : (...) array_like
            A number representing the sign of the determinant. For a real matrix,
            this is 1, 0, or -1. For a complex matrix, this is a complex number
            with absolute value 1 (i.e., it is on the unit circle), or else 0.
        logdet : (...) array_like
            The natural log of the absolute value of the determinant.
        
        If the determinant is zero, then `sign` will be 0 and `logdet` will be
        -Inf. In all cases, the determinant is equal to ``sign * np.exp(logdet)``.

        Examples
        --------
        The determinant of a 2-D array ``[[a, b], [c, d]]`` is ``ad - bc``:

        >>> sign * np.exp(logdet)

        Computing log-determinants for a stack of matrices:

        >>> a.shape

    solve(a, b)
        Solve a linear matrix equation, or system of linear scalar equations.
        
        Computes the "exact" solution, `x`, of the well-determined, i.e., full
        rank, linear matrix equation `ax = b`.
        
        Parameters
        ----------

        Returns
        -------

            Solution to the system a x = b.  Returned shape is identical to `b`.
        
        Raises
        ------

            A real or complex array with ``a.ndim >= 2``.
        full_matrices : bool, optional
            If True (default), `u` and `vh` have the shapes ``(..., M, M)`` and

        Notes
        -----
        
        .. versionchanged:: 1.8.0
           Broadcasting rules apply, see the `numpy.linalg` documentation for
           details.
        
        The decomposition is performed using LAPACK routine ``_gesdd``.
        
        SVD is usually described for the factorization of a 2D matrix :math:`A`.
        The higher-dimensional case will be discussed below. In the 2D case, SVD is
        written as :math:`A = U S V^H`, where :math:`A = a`, :math:`U= u`,
        :math:`S= \mathtt{np.diag}(s)` and :math:`V^H = vh`. The 1D array `s`
        contains the singular values of `a` and `u` and `vh` are unitary. The rows
        of `vh` are the eigenvectors of :math:`A^H A` and the columns of `u` are
        the eigenvectors of :math:`A A^H`. In both cases the corresponding
        (possibly non-zero) eigenvalues are given by ``s**2``.
        
        If `a` has more than two dimensions, then broadcasting rules apply, as
        explained in :ref:`routines.linalg-broadcasting`. This means that SVD is
        working in "stacked" mode: it iterates over all indices of the first
        ``a.ndim - 2`` dimensions and for each combination SVD is applied to the
        last two indices. The matrix `a` can be reconstructed from the
        decomposition with either ``(u * s[..., None, :]) @ vh`` or
        ``u @ (s[..., None] * vh)``. (The ``@`` operator can be replaced by the
        function ``np.matmul`` for python versions below 3.5.)
        
        If `a` is a ``matrix`` object (as opposed to an ``ndarray``), then so are
        all the return values.
        
        Examples
        --------
        >>> a = np.random.randn(9, 6) + 1j*np.random.randn(9, 6)
        >>> b = np.random.randn(2, 7, 8, 3) + 1j*np.random.randn(2, 7, 8, 3)
        
        Reconstruction based on full SVD, 2D case:
        
        >>> u, s, vh = np.linalg.svd(a, full_matrices=True)
        >>> u.shape, s.shape, vh.shape
        ((9, 9), (6,), (6, 6))
        >>> np.allclose(a, np.dot(u[:, :6] * s, vh))
        True
        >>> smat = np.zeros((9, 6), dtype=complex)
        >>> smat[:6, :6] = np.diag(s)
        >>> np.allclose(a, np.dot(u, np.dot(smat, vh)))
        True
        
        Reconstruction based on reduced SVD, 2D case:
        
        >>> u, s, vh = np.linalg.svd(a, full_matrices=False)
        >>> u.shape, s.shape, vh.shape
        ((9, 6), (6,), (6, 6))
        >>> np.allclose(a, np.dot(u * s, vh))
        True
        >>> smat = np.diag(s)
        >>> np.allclose(a, np.dot(u, np.dot(smat, vh)))
        True
        
        Reconstruction based on full SVD, 4D case:
        
        >>> u, s, vh = np.linalg.svd(b, full_matrices=True)
        >>> u.shape, s.shape, vh.shape
        ((2, 7, 8, 8), (2, 7, 3), (2, 7, 3, 3))
        >>> np.allclose(b, np.matmul(u[..., :3] * s[..., None, :], vh))
        True
        >>> np.allclose(b, np.matmul(u[..., :3], s[..., None] * vh))
        True
        
        Reconstruction based on reduced SVD, 4D case:
        
        >>> u, s, vh = np.linalg.svd(b, full_matrices=False)
        >>> u.shape, s.shape, vh.shape
        ((2, 7, 8, 3), (2, 7, 3), (2, 7, 3, 3))
        >>> np.allclose(b, np.matmul(u * s[..., None, :], vh))
        True
        >>> np.allclose(b, np.matmul(u, s[..., None] * vh))
        True
    
    tensorinv(a, ind=2)
        Compute the 'inverse' of an N-dimensional array.
        
        The result is an inverse for `a` relative to the tensordot operation
        ``tensordot(a, b, ind)``, i. e., up to floating-point accuracy,
        ``tensordot(tensorinv(a), a, ind)`` is the "identity" tensor for the
        tensordot operation.
        
        Parameters
        ----------
        a : array_like
            Tensor to 'invert'. Its shape must be 'square', i. e.,
            ``prod(a.shape[:ind]) == prod(a.shape[ind:])``.
        ind : int, optional
            Number of first indices that are involved in the inverse sum.
            Must be a positive integer, default is 2.
        
        Returns
        -------
        b : ndarray
            `a`'s tensordot inverse, shape ``a.shape[ind:] + a.shape[:ind]``.
        
        Raises
        ------
        LinAlgError
            If `a` is singular or not 'square' (in the above sense).

        Examples
        --------
        >>> a = np.eye(4*6)
        >>> a.shape = (4, 6, 8, 3)
        >>> ainv = np.linalg.tensorinv(a, ind=2)
        >>> ainv.shape
        (8, 3, 4, 6)
        >>> b = np.random.randn(4, 6)
        >>> np.allclose(np.tensordot(ainv, b), np.linalg.tensorsolve(a, b))
        True
        
        >>> a = np.eye(4*6)
        >>> a.shape = (24, 8, 3)
        >>> ainv = np.linalg.tensorinv(a, ind=1)
        >>> ainv.shape

        >>> b = np.random.randn(24)
        >>> np.allclose(np.tensordot(ainv, b, 1), np.linalg.tensorsolve(a, b))
        True
    
    tensorsolve(a, b, axes=None)
        Solve the tensor equation ``a x = b`` for x.
        
        It is assumed that all indices of `x` are summed over in the product,
        together with the rightmost indices of `a`, as is done in, for example,
        ``tensordot(a, x, axes=b.ndim)``.
        
        Parameters
        ----------
        a : array_like
            Coefficient tensor, of shape ``b.shape + Q``. `Q`, a tuple, equals
            the shape of that sub-tensor of `a` consisting of the appropriate
            number of its rightmost indices, and must be such that
            ``prod(Q) == prod(b.shape)`` (in which sense `a` is said to be
            'square').
        b : array_like
            Right-hand tensor, which can be of any shape.
        axes : tuple of ints, optional
            Axes in `a` to reorder to the right, before inversion.
            If None (default), no reordering is done.
        
        Returns
        -------
        x : ndarray, shape Q
        
        Raises
        ------
        LinAlgError
            If `a` is singular or not 'square' (in the above sense).

        >>> a = np.eye(2*3*4)
        >>> a.shape = (2*3, 4, 2, 3, 4)
        >>> b = np.random.randn(2*3, 4)
        >>> x = np.linalg.tensorsolve(a, b)

dict_values([29, 39, 11, 8])
Help on dict object:

class dict(object)
 |  dict() -> new empty dictionary
 |  dict(mapping) -> new dictionary initialized from a mapping object's
 |      (key, value) pairs
 |  dict(iterable) -> new dictionary initialized as if via:
 |      d = {}
 |      for k, v in iterable:
 |          d[k] = v
 |  dict(**kwargs) -> new dictionary initialized with the name=value pairs
 |      in the keyword argument list.  For example:  dict(one=1, two=2)
 |  
 |  Built-in subclasses:
 |      StgDict
 |  
 |  Methods defined here:
 |  
 |  __contains__(self, key, /)
 |      True if the dictionary has the specified key, else False.
 |  
 |  __delitem__(self, key, /)
 |      Delete self[key].
 |  
 |  __eq__(self, value, /)
 |      Return self==value.
 |  
 |  __ge__(self, value, /)
 |      Return self>=value.
 |  
 |  __getattribute__(self, name, /)
 |      Return getattr(self, name).
 |  
 |  __getitem__(...)
 |      x.__getitem__(y) <==> x[y]
 |  
 |  __gt__(self, value, /)
 |      Return self>value.
 |  
 |  __init__(self, /, *args, **kwargs)
 |      Initialize self.  See help(type(self)) for accurate signature.
 |  
 |  __iter__(self, /)
 |      Implement iter(self).
 |  
 |  __le__(self, value, /)
 |      Return self<=value.
 |  
 |  __len__(self, /)
 |      Return len(self).
 |  
 |  __lt__(self, value, /)
 |      Return self<value.
 |  
 |  __ne__(self, value, /)
 |      Return self!=value.
 |  
 |  __repr__(self, /)
 |      Return repr(self).
 |  
 |  __reversed__(self, /)
 |      Return a reverse iterator over the dict keys.
 |  
 |  __setitem__(self, key, value, /)
 |      Set self[key] to value.
 |  
 |  __sizeof__(...)
 |      D.__sizeof__() -> size of D in memory, in bytes
 |  
 |  clear(...)
 |      D.clear() -> None.  Remove all items from D.
 |  
 |  copy(...)
 |      D.copy() -> a shallow copy of D
 |  
 |  get(self, key, default=None, /)
 |      Return the value for key if key is in the dictionary, else default.
 |  
 |  items(...)
 |      D.items() -> a set-like object providing a view on D's items
 |  
 |  keys(...)
 |      D.keys() -> a set-like object providing a view on D's keys
 |  
 |  pop(...)
 |      D.pop(k[,d]) -> v, remove specified key and return the corresponding value.
 |      If key is not found, d is returned if given, otherwise KeyError is raised
 |  
 |  popitem(self, /)
 |      Remove and return a (key, value) pair as a 2-tuple.
 |      
 |      Pairs are returned in LIFO (last-in, first-out) order.
 |      Raises KeyError if the dict is empty.
 |  
 |  setdefault(self, key, default=None, /)
 |      Insert key with a value of default if key is not in the dictionary.
 |      
 |      Return the value for key if key is in the dictionary, else default.
 |  
 |  update(...)
 |      D.update([E, ]**F) -> None.  Update D from dict/iterable E and F.
 |      If E is present and has a .keys() method, then does:  for k in E: D[k] = E[k]
 |      If E is present and lacks a .keys() method, then does:  for k, v in E: D[k] = v
 |      In either case, this is followed by: for k in F:  D[k] = F[k]
 |  
 |  values(...)
 |      D.values() -> an object providing a view on D's values
 |  
 |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------
 |  Class methods defined here:
 |  
 |  fromkeys(iterable, value=None, /) from builtins.type
 |      Create a new dictionary with keys from iterable and values set to value.
 |  
 |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------
 |  Static methods defined here:
 |  
 |  __new__(*args, **kwargs) from builtins.type
 |      Create and return a new object.  See help(type) for accurate signature.

Help on built-in function iter in module builtins:

iter(...)
    iter(iterable) -> iterator
    iter(callable, sentinel) -> iterator
    
    Get an iterator from an object.  In the first form, the argument must
    supply its own iterator, or be a sequence.
    In the second form, the callable is called until it returns the sentinel.

Dear Sir or Madame,


I am pleased to provide you with this online letter of recommendation in support of George Kudryavtsev. I am supervisor of his research work at the department of Computational Mathematics and Cybernetics at Lomonosov Moscow State University.

I first met George in September, 2014 when he came to learn about my scientific interests. He also spoke to my colleagues and demonstrated his deep interest to our scientific field. George had excellent academic progress and I was glad to become his research advisor. George attended lectures and seminars I gave at the department. I could positively say that George was among the top students of the group. I would like to make special mention of George talent to learn and structure new information. I also supervised Georges scientific research. I would like to mention his high motivation for research work and organizational abilities.

His research was devoted to recommender systems.  In addition George employed his good programming skills to implement many algorithms.
I consider George as a very promising researcher and confidently recommend his for the master's program at the Skolkovo Institute of Science and Technology.

If you require any further information, please do not hesitate to contact me: djakonov@mail.ru.

Dyakonov A. G.
Doctor of Sciences,
Professor of Department of Mathematical Methods of Forecasting at Lomonosov Moscow State University
